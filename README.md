# Hi there üëãüèª
This repository is dedicated to my Java exercises where I practice fundamental programming concepts.

### [Black Jack](https://github.com/Shimmyland/MiniGames/tree/main/BlackJack)

üöß Work in progress

### [One Class Games](https://github.com/Shimmyland/MiniGames/tree/main/OneClassGames)
This folder contains simple exercises I created while learning Java. It includes 
[GuessTheNumber](https://github.com/Shimmyland/MiniGames/blob/main/OneClassGames/src/GuessTheNumber.java), 
[RockPaperScissors](https://github.com/Shimmyland/MiniGames/blob/main/OneClassGames/src/RockPaperScissors.java), 
[TicTacToe](https://github.com/Shimmyland/MiniGames/blob/main/OneClassGames/src/TicTacToe.java). 
All of them are focused on practicing creating methods, using conditinal statements and take inputs and souting outputs in console.

### [Snake](https://github.com/Shimmyland/MiniGames/tree/main/Snake)
In this exercise, I modified and extended [Kenny Yip's Snake code](https://github.com/ImKennyYip/snake-java). 
The goal was to understand GUI programming using Java's Swing library.

### [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/Shimmyland/MiniGames/tree/main/ticTacToe)
This was my first self-created task containing more then one class. Although there's already a Tic Tac Toe game here, I decided to create a more complex version. 
In this mini-game, you can set the number of players you want to play with and customize the size of your board.
My focus was on grasping the underlying principles of the game and applying them through object-oriented programming (OOP).
